The script file begins by creating a directory called jlim064_data (if it doesn't exist) to store the creations.

function list:
1) readInput()
- Prompt the user to select operation the user want to perform
- It must be one of [l/p/d/c/q] (list/play/delete/create/quit respectively).

2) confirmQuit()
- Asks the user for confirmation of 'quit' operation

3) listCreations()
- Lists the creation in the 'jlim064_data' directory if there are any

4) deletion()
- Lists the creation in the 'jlim064_data' directory if there are any, and prompts the user to select one creation to delete

5) createCreation()
- Asks the user for the name of creation, if there already exists the same name of creation the program asks the user whether the use wants to overwrite the creation
- User enters a number to be used for the creation. If the user input is non-integer, it prints an error message and asks the user to enter a number again.
- It then makes a video from the text which is placed in 'video' directory, records the user voice for the number which is placed in 'audio' directory, and merges video and audio files together which is place in 'final' direcoty. All of these are done via ffmpeg
- Audio recording has been tested in the lab with a headphone microphone plugged and with 'hw:0'.

6) playCreations()
- Lists the creation in the 'jlim064_data' directory if there are any, and prompts the user to select one creation to play via ffplay
